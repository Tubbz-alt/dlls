# Z3

```
mkdir build64
cd build64
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ../
```

Double click on Z3.sln and compile all projects with Visual Studio 2019.
The provided DLL is a debug build for 64 bits.
Nothing else worked for me on Windows.

The used Z3 version is 65de3f748a6812eecd7db7c478d5fc54424d368b
